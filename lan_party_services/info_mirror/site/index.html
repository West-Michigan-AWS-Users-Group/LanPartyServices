            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p><strong>Venue:</strong> We will be setup in a large room in the basement of a church. The Community church is allowing us to host this party in their space. We ask that everyone remain respectful of the space and clean up after yourselves so we can continue to do this in the future.</p>
            <p><strong>PC Gaming:</strong> We have set up dedicated servers for a handful of classic games. A lot of the classics have multi-platform game clients (Windows, OSX, Linux), with some requiring file-assets. We will have a website hosting the assets for download, along with links and information for each game. LAN parties take their own course, so come pre-installed with any game you want to try to strike up a game for.</p>
            <p><strong>Nintendo Switch:</strong> We will have a section with a Nintendo Switch setup. </p>
            <p><strong>Tables and Seating:</strong> The venue is providing tables and chairs for participants. Just bring your computer and peripherals.</p>
            <p><strong>Networking:</strong> A 48 port gigabit switch will be provided for an uplink, so be sure to bring a long ethernet cable. I am also seeking volunteer(s) to bring any small layer 2 switches they might find useful. Wifi is provided, but not stress tested. Please have all the games you would like to play pre-installed to avoid any possible network congestion, and if you have something to bring to help the situation, please feel free to bring it!</p>
            <p><strong>Food:</strong> The gaming room has an attached kitchen complete with fridges/sinks/countertops. We will have a place to store and prep food. Feel free to bring your favorite snack, and/or we could order a bunch of pizzas if everyone wants to pitch in. Utensils, plates and solo cups will be provided.</p>
            <p><strong>Beverage:</strong> Bring your own beverage. Beer, wine and seltzer is allowed. Please do not bring any hard liquor into the venue.</p>
            <p><strong>Sound:</strong> There will be some tunes going in the background. We do ask that for audio you bring a headset/earbuds and leave the desk speakers at home. I plan to setup a Discord server for in-game comms. That information will be shared the day of the party.</p>
            <p><strong>Capacity:</strong> We are limiting the capacity to 25 attendees. If you need to cancel or update an RSVP, please contact me.</p>
            <p><strong>Age:</strong> We ask that only adults (18+) attend this party.</p>
            <h2>What to Bring</h2>
            <p>There is a good forum post <a href="https://linustechtips.com/topic/741361-checklist-to-be-prepared-for-lan-party/">here</a> on what to bring. As previously mentioned, you are not required to bring a chair or table. Just come with the games pre-installed that you want to play and don't forget to bring your longest network cable. Bring a snack to share if you would like.</p>
