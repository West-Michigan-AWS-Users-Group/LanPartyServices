# This code shows a very brief and small example of how to create a bot with our library.

# The first thing you need to do is import the library.
import interactions

# Now, let's create an instance of a bot.
# When you make a bot, we refer to it as the "client."
# The client is the main object that interacts with the Gateway, what talks to Discord.
# The client is also the main object that interacts with the API, what makes requests with Discord.
# The client can also have "intents" that are what the bot recieves,
# in this case the default ones and message content (a privilaged intent that needs
# to be enabled in the developer portal)

#   if you want to do this manually, you can do it by passing disable_sync=False in the Client
#   object on line 13.
# - we are not setting a presence.
# - we are not automatically sharding, and registering the connection under 1 shard.
# - we are using default intents, which are Gateway intents excluding privileged ones
# - and the privilaged message content intent.
